# Slovenia Smart Guide ðŸŒ²
*Your intelligent, personalized travel planner for discovering the wonders of Slovenia.*

This project is a web application designed to eliminate the complexity of travel planning. For first-time visitors to a diverse country like Slovenia, choosing between the Alps, the coast, cities, and caves can be overwhelming. This smart guide uses a powerful rule-based system to dynamically generate optimized and personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences.

## Key Features

The application is divided into two main roles, each with a dedicated set of features:

### For the User (Traveler)

- **Personalized Plan Generation**  
  Input your travel preferences, including the number of days, budget, fitness level, interests, and mode of transport.

- **Dynamic Itinerary Creation**  
  Receive a detailed, day-by-day travel plan automatically generated by a sophisticated rules engine.

- **Intelligent Classification**  
  At the end of the process, the system analyzes your plan and gives it a descriptive classification, like *"Extreme Alpine Expedition"* or *"Relaxed Cultural City Break"*.

- **Real-time Alerts**  
  The system provides logistical warnings (e.g., *"This day's plan is too ambitious"*) and can react to real-time events (like road closures) to provide critical alerts during your trip.

- **Day Trip Tools**  
  Explore potential day trips from a chosen base location or validate the travel time between two points of interest.

- **Modern UI**  
  A clean, responsive interface with light/dark modes and custom-designed components for a seamless user experience.

---

### For the Administrator

- **Location Management (CRUD)**  
  A full interface to create, read, update, and delete locations and attractions (e.g., Bled, Postojna Cave).

- **Route Management (CRUD)**  
  Manage the travel network by defining the average travel times between key locations.

- **Dynamic Rule Parameter Control**  
  Modify the core logic of the rules engine directly from the UI without changing any code.  
  *Example: An admin can change the ticket price limits that define a "low" or "medium" budget.*
